# comp_stats_simulations

This repository contains 2 jupityer notebooks with small simulation studies which were assignments for the course Computational Statistics (Uni Bonn).



**ProblemSet_PCA.ipynb** :   
The aim of this problem set was to implement Principle Component Analysis in R and compare the method to OLS, Ridge, and Lasso estimation w.r.t. to its prediction error in different settings. To do that, we conducted Monte-Carlo simulations.

**ProblemSet_PCA.ipynb**:   
The aim of this exercise was to compare coverage probabilities of analytical confidence intervals and bootstrapped confidence intervals.
The two types of confidence intervals were evaluated along two dimensions, interval length and coverage probability, in a small simulation study.

The aim of the assignments in the course Computational Statistics was to implement different concepts and methods from data science in R and interpret the results.
Concepts/methods covered in the course included:
- Classification
- Validation
- Resampling Methods
- Regularization Techniques
- Regression Trees, random forests, bagging, boosting stacked methods/ensemble methods
- Causal forests
- Deep Learning/Neural Networks
